## Quick Setup Guide

To add Mrs. Georgette Youssef's professional photo to the platform, follow these simple steps:

---

## 📁 **Step 1: Prepare the Photo**

### **Photo Requirements:**
- ✅ **Format:** JPG, PNG, or WebP
- ✅ **Size:** Minimum 400x400px (square works best)
- ✅ **Quality:** High-resolution, clear, professional

## 📥 **Step 2: Add the Photo File**

### **Option A: Add to Client Public Folder**

1. **Navigate to the client folder:**
   ```
   C:\Users\David.s\Gy Platform\client\public\
   ```

2. **Place your photo file there** and name it:
   ```
   teacher-photo.jpg
   ```

3. **That's it!** The platform is already configured to use this file.

### **Option B: Use a Different Name**

If you want to use a different filename (e.g., `georgette.jpg`):

1. Place the photo in `client/public/`

2. Update these files:
   - `client/src/pages/LandingPage.jsx` (line 194 and 475)
   
   Change:
   ```jsx
   src="/teacher-photo.jpg"
   ```
   
   To:
   ```jsx
   src="/georgette.jpg"
   ```

## 🎨 **Step 3: Optimize the Photo (Optional but Recommended)**

### **Online Tools:**
- **TinyPNG** (tinypng.com) - Compress without quality loss
- **Squoosh** (squoosh.app) - Google's image optimizer
- **Remove.bg** (remove.bg) - Remove background if needed

### **Ideal Specifications:**
```
Dimensions: 400x400px to 800x800px (square)
Format: JPG (smaller) or PNG (if transparency needed)
File Size: 50KB - 200KB
Quality: 80-90%
```

---

## ✅ **Step 4: Verify the Photo is Working**

1. **Save the photo** in `client/public/teacher-photo.jpg`

2. **Refresh the browser:**
   - Open: http://localhost:5173
   - Press: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (hard refresh)

3. **Check two locations:**
   - **Hero Section** (right side) - Large profile card
   - **About Section** (below) - Smaller profile display

4. **Photo should appear** with a beautiful gradient border!

---

## 🔄 **Fallback Behavior**

If the photo is not found, the platform will automatically show:
- **"GY" initials** with gradient colors
- Professional appearance maintained
- No broken image icons

This ensures the site always looks professional, even while you're setting up the photo.

### **1. Hero Section - Main Profile Card**
- Location: Right side of hero
- Size: 160x160px circular
- Style: White background with gradient border
- Shadow: Large shadow for depth

### **2. About Teacher Section**
- Location: Lower on page
- Size: 128x128px circular
- Style: Similar professional styling

### **3. All instances automatically update!**
